My final project for CS 4, this is a website that provides information about the Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign I am currently running for my friends, Curse of Strahd. The website is a work in progress, but demonstrates how a user might add and browse NPCs and locations.

The website is also available at https://2324.lakeside-cs.org/IanS/finalproject/
